Development of robust parameterizations for geological facies  models. 

We present reports the current results of our investigations on the use of deep neural networks towards the construction of a continuous parameterization of facies which can be used for data assimilation with ensemble methods. 
Specifically, we use a convolutional variational autoencoder and the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation. 

# Result

We tested the parameterization in three synthetic history-matching problems with channelized facies.
We focus on this type of facies because they are among the most challenging to preserve after the assimilation of data. 

# Conclusions
The parameterization showed promising results outperforming previous methods and generating well-defined channelized facies.
